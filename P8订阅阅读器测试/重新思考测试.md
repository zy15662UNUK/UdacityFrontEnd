##### Always failure
- failure is the only option
##### Validating an option
- start to identify areas in our code in which your are seeting expections
for example:
```
function add(x,y) {return x+y;}
add(2,3);    //5
```
###### Expection on how this function will be used
1. The add() function has been defined and actually exists
2. The function is actually accomplishing our intended task if this call were to return a different number like 6, it indicate that I have messed up the function.
3. add('a','b')//'ab'
So in all the expection should be:
- expect 2+3=5
- expect error if non numbers are used
- expect 0.1+0.3=0.4
Now we can start to rebuild the test
```
function add(x,y) {
  if ((typeof x && typeof y) !== 'number'){
    throw new Error("Params must be a number")
  }
}
var result =  x+y;
if (parseInt(result) !== result) {
  result = parseFloat(result.toFixed(1));
}
return result;
```
##### Write expection with code
- expect 2+3=5
```
expect(add(2,3)).toBe(5);
```
- expect error if non numbers are used
```
expect(add(2,'test')).toThrow();
```
- expect 0.1+0.2=0.3s
```
expect(add(0.1,0.2)).toBe(0.3);
```

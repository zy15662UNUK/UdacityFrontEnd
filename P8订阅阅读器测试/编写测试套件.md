###### Jasmine
- Library provided to test the code
###### Spec and runner page (How to organize the test)
- From the PlayerSpec.js, we can see "describe" and "it"
- "it" is used to identify a specification, or a spec, for short. A spec is just a container for a test.
for example: the "it" is named "should be able to play a Song"
```
it("should be able to play a Song", function() {
  player.play(song);
  expect(player.currentlyPlayingSong).toEqual(song);

  //demonstrates use of custom matcher
  expect(player).toBePlaying(song);
});
```
- if <b>all of</b> the expectations within a spec return true, then that spec passes. <b>if any return false, the spec would fail.</b>
So it is just like a boundray for the tests.
- Describe is used to identify a suite, which is a group of related specs
- In this case the suite is called "Player", which tells us that everything wthin this block is related to the Player
##### Write the test
```
expect(add(0.1,0.2)).toBe(0.3);
```
- accepts single variable called the actual which is the function we want to test.
- .toBe() is a matcher, a equivalent of strict equals comparision
- This test is equivalent to ``` add(0.1,0.2)===0.3;```
- negate test:
```
expect(add(0.1,0.2)).not.toBe(0.1); //
```
##### Red green refactor cycle
1. Write your test first and they all fail since there is no code to make them pass
2. Then write the code required to make your test passes
3. Refactor your code as continue to add new features
##### Write test and implementation
- Test in ```  <script src="spec/AddressBookSpec.js"></script>```
- implementation in ```  <script src="src/AddressBook.js"></script>```
- Write the test with the test of functionality, then based on the test to write implementation
